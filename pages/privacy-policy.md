# Data Collected on This Website

## Web server logs and security

This website is hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). Netlify stores access logs including the IP addresses of this site visitors, for less than 30 days. You can find more details in [Netlify privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/gdpr/).

This website does not store any additional logs other than ones stored by Netlify.

## Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics to collect anonymised statistics about website visitors and performance.

Google Analytics is set up in ['consent' mode](https://developers.google.com/gtagjs/devguide/consent) with consent permanently disabled (`ad_storage` permanently set to `denied`). When 'ad_storage' is 'denied', new cookies will not be set for advertising purposes. Data sent to Google will still include the full page URL, including any ad click information in the URL parameters.

[URL Passthrough](https://developers.google.com/gtagjs/devguide/consent#url_passthrough) is enabled. With this setting Google Analytics may pass information through URL parameters across pages in order to improve measurement quality.

Google's privacy policy can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Comments

This website uses [Remark42](https://remark42.com/) comment system. The remark42
is self-hosted by author of this website on [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) in Hetzner Cloud datacenters in Finland. Remark42 collects minimal amount of information necessary to provide comment service: authentication information and comments text, as well as some information necessary for debugging / abuse detection such as IP addresses.

Authentication is provided by 3rd party services. Please consult their privacy policies when choosing to authenticate. Authentication is only required for posting comments, reading comments does not expose your data to any third-party services. Unfortunately the author of this site did not find a way to enable anonymous posting without exposing website to spam and fraudulent posts.

Remark42 is an open-source software, and authors [publish](https://github.com/umputun/remark42#privacy) following privacy claims:

*   Remark42 is trying to be very sensitive to any private or semi-private information.
*   Authentication requesting the minimal possible scope from authentication providers. All extra information returned by them dropped immediately and not stored in any form.
*   Generally, remark42 keeps user id, username and avatar link only. None of these fields exposed directly - id and name hashed, avatar proxied.
*   There is no tracking of any sort.
*   Login mechanic uses JWT stored in a cookie (httpOnly, secured). The second cookie (XSRF_TOKEN) is a random id preventing CSRF.
*   There is no cross-site login, i.e., user's behaviour can't be analyzed across independent sites running remark42.
*   There are no third-party analytic services involved.
*   User can request all information remark42 knows about and export to gz file.
*   Supported complete cleanup of all information related to user's activity.
*   Cookie lifespan can be restricted to session-only.
*   All potentially sensitive data stored by remark42 hashed and encrypted.

## Cookies

The website itself does not use any cookies. However:

*   Google Analytics stores "_ga" cookie to provide statistics about returning visitors. Owners of the website do not have access to this cookies, and Google Analytics is set up in a way which does not exposes any PII (see above).
*   For authenticated visitors comment system (remark42) stores two cookies: one containing login information, and one random (XSRF_TOKEN) to prevent cross-site scripting. Both cookies are required for correct functionality of the comment system. The cookies are limited to "comments.rusinov.ie" subdomain and are not passed to any 3rd parties.
