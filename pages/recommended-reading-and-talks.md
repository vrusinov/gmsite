The following posts and talks moved me in one way or another, so I recommend you read/watch them too.

* [Incident Analysis: How *Learning* is Different Than *Fixing* - John Allspaw](https://youtu.be/Zw_ASI-rk1s) - 2020 video. A few points resonated with me:
    *  Severity of the incident has nothing to do with how difficult and interesting it was
    *  Good postmortems are stories - they use typical story-telling techniques and are interesting to read
    *  Often postmortems become box-ticking exercises. Many postmortems are written to be filed, not read. This happens even in pioneering SRE orgs like Google.
* [Andrew Clay Shafer - SRE as She Is Spoke](https://youtu.be/G5yIUkJTzw8) - 2022 video.
    * Are you SRE?
    * Are you DevOps?
    * Are you a new buzzword?
    * Who cares!
* [KNOW YOUR “ONE JOB” AND DO IT FIRST](https://charity.wtf/2021/03/07/know-your-one-job-and-do-it-first/) and [follow-up](https://charity.wtf/2021/03/09/know-your-one-job-continued/)
