# Donating with Liberapay

Recently I've stumbled upon [Liberapay](liberapay.com).

Liberapay is a non-profit crowdfunding platform. The most interesting thing is that Liberapay does not charge fee for donations. Instead, it relies on donations itself. So Liberapay [has account on Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/Liberapay/). Another big upside is that it appears to be [entirely open-source](https://github.com/liberapay).

The biggest downside is that it does not appear to be very popular, so there is not all that many things to donate to there.

Still, I found a few things and set up a few tiny recurring donations.

Then I thought it would be interesting to get some. Mostly as a social experiment - I would be surprised to get a single cent.

## Receiving donations from Liberapay

The setup was fairly straightforward. Any registered user can add Stripe or PayPal account. I was not registered in either, so I opted to sign up for Stripe which took around 10 minutes.

Then in order to attract people I've installed a couple of buttons on this website. It required a small modification of templates. The buttons use JavaScript but appear to have a fallback, and don't appear to set or collect any cookies.

It is also quite easy to add "Donate" button to GitHub. Once simply needs to place `.github/FUNDING.yml` file to their default branch. For me it looked like this:
```yaml
liberapay: rvs
```

There are [more docs and examples on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository).

## Donate away

Click my button, [give me some money](https://liberapay.com/rvs/donate). I don't intend to profit on it, and would try to match anything given to me, though quite likely not through Liberapay unless it suddenly becomes more popular.

I found following interesting (to me) projects there:

* [Liberapay itself](https://en.liberapay.com/Liberapay/)
* [Syncthing](https://en.liberapay.com/Syncthing/) - Open-Source p2p file synchronization tool. I did not set up donation in Liberapay since I already donate through other channels.
* [LVFS](https://en.liberapay.com/LVFS/) - collaborative initiative to install firmware in Linux
