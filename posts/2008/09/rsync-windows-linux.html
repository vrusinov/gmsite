But there is rsync build for cygwin - <a href="http://www.itefix.no/i2/node/10650">cwRsync</a>. You can download it from:<br><a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sereds/cwRsync_2.1.5_Installer.zip?modtime=1220778493&amp;big_mirror=0">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sereds/cwRsync_2.1.5_Installer.zip</a><br><br><b>2. Add $CYGWIN_INSTALL_PATH/bin/ to PATH environment</b>:<br>Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Environment<br><br><b>3. Fix problem with non-ascii filenames</b><br><br>Here is the message describing a problem:<br><br><br><br><pre>&gt;I'm trying to use rsync (version 2.6.9) to back up some files. However, a few <br>&gt;of them contain Hebrew characters. While I can back them up, the filenames <br>&gt;come through scrambled (I don't have Hebrew characters anymore). I've tried <br>&gt;the -8 switch, but that didn't work. Any suggestions?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Background:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The files are created on Windows and saved on a samba share (v3.0.24). I can <br>&gt;copy them around in Windows just fine. Konqueror, on the machine the files <br>&gt;are physically on shows the file names properly. But when I copy them using <br>&gt;rsync, the file names get scrambled (Hebrew characters only; English <br>&gt;characters are fine).<br><br>I guess you're using cwrsync which uses the cygwin1.dll. The normal release<br>is not unicode aware and therefore has problems with non-ascii characters.<br>I also had this problem with German umlauts. There is a unicode-release<br>of the cygwin1.dll which you can copy over your existing cygwin1.dll.<br>In my case the problems went away. The characters still look strange when<br>looked at in Linux (different codepage, encoding...) but at least from the<br>samba share they're the same.<br><br>http://www.okisoft.co.jp/esc/utf8-cygwin/<br></pre><br><br>So, replace cygwin.dll with version that could be downloaded from from <a href="http://www.okisoft.co.jp/esc/utf8-cygwin/">http://www.okisoft.co.jp/esc/utf8-cygwin/</a><br><br><b>Done</b><br>Don't forget to add --iconv=. to rsync command-line options (--incov introduced in rsync 3.0).<br></div></body></html>
