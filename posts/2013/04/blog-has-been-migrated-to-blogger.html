<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Hi there,<br><br>I've moved blog from old Drupal on one of old servers I support to hosted Google Blogger. I've also got a chance to clean up old &amp; irrelevant posts so... there's only 3 of them now. I'll try to use time freed up from maintaining my Drupal instance on writing some posts, but I won't promise anything.</div></body></html>
