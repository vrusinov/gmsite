<html><body><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">So I wanted to make my website a little bit fancier. The problem is that I'm not a web designer, I'm bad with modern css &amp; javascript world and I'm not very interested in diving in to it. So I decided to look around - maybe there's something that can help me.<br><br>Looks like there is: <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is web frontend framework which allows relatively easy build clean but good-looking sites. Current version is 2.3.1, but version 3.0 is just round the corner so I thought it's a good idea to start with it now in order to avoid migration later. The problem is it's poorly documented and it was not very clear where to start from but I decided to try anyway.<br><br><a name="more"></a><h3 style="text-align: left;">Downloading &amp; building</h3><div>There's no downloads for 3.0 yet, but there's public repo on github. Let's fetch it:</div><div><br></div><pre class="brush: bash"># Clone repo:<br>git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git<br>cd bootstrap<br># Switch to 3.0 branch<br>git checkout 3.0.0-wip<br># Make sure we are using 3.0 as expected:<br>less README.md<br></pre>Now, let's build it. We'll need some tools from node.js for it (like jshint). There are no rpm's or other linux-friendly packages for jshint, but there's npm with is some kind of package manager (or my, another one?) for javascript. I'm on Fedora 18, so I can easily install npm. If you are on some other distro you may have to find 3-rd pary package for it first.  <br><pre class="brush: bash">sudo yum install npm<br># From bootstrap folder: local-install necessary dependencies:<br>npm install<br></pre>Now finally let's make it:  <br><pre class="bursh: bash">make<br></pre><pre class="bursh: bash"><br></pre><pre class="bursh: bash">Yay, It successfully compiled some javascripts. Err... now what?</pre><h2 style="text-align: left;">Bootstrap 3 docs</h2><div>There are no docs online for version 3. However, there are something in docs/ subdirectory of github repo. It's in weird format, so I had to figure out how to read them.</div><div><br></div><div>After a quick Google search <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15318984/compile-boostrap-3-docs-how-to">I found out</a> that docs may be done by something called Jekyll. Turned out it's a website generator written on Ruby, so there's another package manager comes to play (oh dear...):</div><div><br></div> <pre class="brush: bash"><br>sudo yum install ruby-devel<br>gem install jekyll<br></pre> <div>It installed jekyll to ~/bin/jekyll, so it's time to run it:</div><div><br></div> <pre class="brush: bash"><br>jekyll . /tmp/bootstrap3-docs/</pre></div><br>google-chrome /tmp/bootstrap3-docs/docs/index.html &amp;<br> <div>So, there are docs, but some links are broken because they are absolute starting with /. Let's just serve it on localhost:</div> <pre class="brush: bash"><br>cd /tmp/bootstrap3-docs&lt;<br>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &amp;<br>google-chrome http://localhost:8000/ &amp;<br></pre> <div>Here it is! Now I need to spend some time exploring it before writing next post. :)</div></body></html>
